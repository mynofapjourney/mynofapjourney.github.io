# Day 1 - Friday, June 2, 2023
Welcome to my website. In case you are interested in "NoFap" and want to understand what it means, a good resource is this: https://nofap.com/porn-addiction/

I have been fighting against my porn and masturbation addiction for at least 13 years now. In total, I have attempted to leave this addiction more often than I can count.

I have also had successes: Had phases of approx. 40 days where I was completely free of the addiction. But up until now, I have not been able to free myself entirely.

The fight has had many phases: I was fighting it all by myself for a long time, then I later discovered the App Fortify (https://www.joinfortify.com) which I then used for a few years. That was a big help. In parallel, or also afterwards, I realised that there is an active subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/). I have been on this subreddit for multiple years, under three different usernames. Right now I am not active on any of those.

I have a life partner, so in theory also a sex partner. In practice, the addiction has not left me, and my sex life is - well, how to say this? ðŸ˜… - pretty much dead. It is really really sad.

In recent weeks and months, I have started building certain habits which are supposed to form a counter-balance to the excessive time I used to spend searching for porn. I decided that my life has to be lived more offline than online. This is also one of my reasons for deleting my reddit account.

Another thing I realised is that the goal cannot be to suppress my sexual feelings. It is completely normal to have a sexual appetite and to crave sex, but it is not normal to then masturbate all the time rather than, say, once a week, especially when you have a sex partner.

I am going to do a 90-day-reboot. This is a process which has become common among the r/NoFap community. The idea is this: Keep away from pornography and masturbation for 90 days, and then you can pretty much assume that you have overcome the addiction, and given your brain time to rewire. And man, it is difficult to reach the 90 days.

And although I will be strict about it, I will not be super paranoid. If I accidentally see a pornographic image, I do not count that as a failiure - unless it draws me into actively seeking out porn of any kind.

Here is a template to keep track of 90 days (just colour one field every day): https://mynofapjourney.github.io/90day-template.JPG

Take care, world. All the best, and don't blow yourself up while I am away.

# Day 2 - Saturday, June 3, 2023
Today I am going on a trip for a few days together with my partner. I survived last night without a failiure. Usually, for me, the night and the early morning are the most dangerous times where I tend to fail.

I hope we have sex during our trip. But I also think it is quite unlikely. We might try once or twice, but will it be good? Will it be bad and disappointing?

Until tomorrow, folks!

# Day 3 - Sunday, June 4, 2023
I am still on my holiday, until tomorrow evening.

# Day 4 - Monday, June 5, 2023
The holiday was very relaxing until now. We spent a lot of time in nature. Sadly, we didn't have any sex.

If I observe the sexual fantasies which ran through my mind now and then while outside yesterday, I realise that I have a tendency towards sadistic thoughts and imaginations.

Oh and I also want to mention that I created a new reddit account: I am u/mynofapjourney2023. You can get in contact with me via reddit if you like.

I found a good reddit post on r/NoFap, which should be interesting for anybody interested in what NoFap is all about. It is a few pages from a book from the year 1948:

# Day 5 - Tuesday, June 6, 2023
We are back home from our short holiday. I have got one day of leave today. Very nice holiday, nice time in nature, calm time, but no sex at all.

Today in the afternoon I have an appointment which will be very challenging. I am somewhat scared of it. I am anxious and nervous. I will have to talk about things which are difficult for me to talk about. It cannot be postponed.

I am also not so relaxed because there are so many things which need to be done at home, but I don't feel up to any of it.

Me and my partner sleep separately. This is mainly because the bed is too uncomfortable for two people. But this will also have to change.

Today while waking up I was having a lot of sexual thoughts. It is usually in the morning hours that I have a lot of sexual thoughts, when the last days have been without an orgasm. Sadly, my partner is sleepy and definitely not ready for or interested in sex in the morning hours.

I hope I survive this day today in every way. Tomorrow morning I will be at my workplace.
