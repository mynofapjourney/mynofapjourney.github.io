# Day 1 - Friday, June 2, 2023
Welcome to my website. In case you are interested in "NoFap" and want to understand what it means, a good resource is this: https://nofap.com/porn-addiction/

I have been fighting against my porn and masturbation addiction for at least 13 years now. In total, I have attempted to leave this addiction more often than I can count.

I have also had successes: Had phases of approx. 40 days where I was completely free of the addiction. But up until now, I have not been able to free myself entirely.

The fight has had many phases: I was fighting it all by myself for a long time, then I later discovered the App Fortify (https://www.joinfortify.com) which I then used for a few years. That was a big help. In parallel, or also afterwards, I realised that there is an active subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/). I have been on this subreddit for multiple years, under three different usernames. Right now I am not active on any of those.

I have a life partner, so in theory also a sex partner. In practice, the addiction has not left me, and my sex life is - well, how to say this? ðŸ˜… - pretty much dead. It is really really sad.

In recent weeks and months, I have started building certain habits which are supposed to form a counter-balance to the excessive time I used to spend searching for porn. I decided that my life has to be lived more offline than online. This is also one of my reasons for deleting my reddit account.

Another thing I realised is that the goal cannot be to suppress my sexual feelings. It is completely normal to have a sexual appetite and to crave sex, but it is not normal to then masturbate all the time rather than, say, once a week, especially when you have a sex partner.

I am going to do a 90-day-reboot. This is a process which has become common among the r/NoFap community. The idea is this: Keep away from pornography and masturbation for 90 days, and then you can pretty much assume that you have overcome the addiction, and given your brain time to rewire. And man, it is difficult to reach the 90 days.

And although I will be strict about it, I will not be super paranoid. If I accidentally see a pornographic image, I do not count that as a failiure - unless it draws me into actively seeking out porn of any kind.

Here is a template to keep track of 90 days (just colour one field every day): https://mynofapjourney.github.io/90day-template.JPG

Take care, world. All the best, and don't blow yourself up while I am away.

# Day 2 - Saturday, June 3, 2023
Today I am going on a trip for a few days together with my partner. I survived last night without a failiure. Usually, for me, the night and the early morning are the most dangerous times where I tend to fail.

I hope we have sex during our trip. But I also think it is quite unlikely. We might try once or twice, but will it be good? Will it be bad and disappointing?

Until tomorrow, folks!

# Day 3 - Sunday, June 4, 2023
I am still on my holiday, until tomorrow evening.

# Day 4 - Monday, June 5, 2023
The holiday was very relaxing until now. We spent a lot of time in nature. Sadly, we didn't have any sex.

If I observe the sexual fantasies which ran through my mind now and then while outside yesterday, I realise that I have a tendency towards sadistic thoughts and imaginations.

Oh and I also want to mention that I created a new reddit account: I am u/mynofapjourney2023. You can get in contact with me via reddit if you like.

I found a good reddit post on r/NoFap, which should be interesting for anybody interested in what NoFap is all about. It is a few pages from a book from the year 1948:

# Day 5 - Tuesday, June 6, 2023
We are back home from our short holiday. I have got one day of leave today. Very nice holiday, nice time in nature, calm time, but no sex at all.

Today in the afternoon I have an appointment which will be very challenging. I am somewhat scared of it. I am anxious and nervous. I will have to talk about things which are difficult for me to talk about. It cannot be postponed.

I am also not so relaxed because there are so many things which need to be done at home, but I don't feel up to any of it.

Me and my partner sleep separately. This is mainly because the bed is too uncomfortable for two people. But this will also have to change.

Today while waking up I was having a lot of sexual thoughts. It is usually in the morning hours that I have a lot of sexual thoughts, when the last days have been without an orgasm. Sadly, my partner is sleepy and definitely not ready for or interested in sex in the morning hours.

I hope I survive this day today in every way. Tomorrow morning I will be at my workplace.

# Day 6 - Wednesday, June 7, 2023
Hello to all people following this blog. I am writing to you from my workplace.

I survived the challenging talk yesterday. It will take time until the things I want to talk about can actually be addressed. But yesterday was a start. ðŸ™‚

Yesterday night I almost failed. I was, as usual, having my fantasies in the night, lying alone in my bed. My partner had not shown any interest in sex. I was getting quite aroused with my fantasies, but then stopped before it was too late. Took a break, wore a pyjama, turned around in bed, and did not fail. Slept off quite soon after that.

I have started reading a new book. This is good, because reading is a good alternative to spending meaningless time online, which could in turn lead to searching for sexual content on porn sites or somewhere else.

Yesterday, I also spent time clearing up home. There is still a lot to do there, but I also got a lot done towards the goal of making home feel homely again.

On June 12, I have a 10 km race which I am going to participate in. I need to train for this. Maybe today evening I should go to the gym.

Ok, time to try and get some work done.

# Day 7 - Thursday, June 8, 2023
In about two hours, I would have completed a full week without fapping or orgasming in any other way, watching porn, or having sex.

Yesterday night I watched a video which motivated me for today. It is by a youtube channel called "After Skool" and I do not like all of their content. But this video is worth sharing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma4VZ7rxGOw

Today in the morning I went to the gym. I am preparing for a race which will be in four days: 10 kilometres. Later, even went swimming. So all in all, a very active day. Didn't eat too much but also not too less.

Spent most of the rest of the evening watching the live performances of the eurovision song contest 2023 finals. It is on youtube.

Now I am feeling sleepy, and I really am thinking of how important it is to develop personality, and also, what is my personality, anyway? I am confused about my goals in life.

Take care, all who read this. Have a great day.

# Day 8 - Friday, June 9, 2023
Hello world. Back at work today. It would be sufficient to put in just a few hours today. Let me see how motivated I am.

Tomorrow I am helping out as a waiter in a party. That might be fun - let's see.

My legs are tired after all the sports yesterday. Need to take it easy today.

# Day 9 - Saturday, June 10, 2023
The evening and night was super tough. Nofap is now becoming a load: I feel as if I am denying myself a very basic need. I am quite frustrated that my partner and me aren't engaging in sex at all.

It is summer and women who feel comfortable with their body are showing it off in short clothing and nice dresses. I am enjoying seeing this.

The party is today afternoon. My job as waiter is yet to begin.

Time to get out of bed now. Until tomorrow!

# Day 10 - Sunday, June 11, 2023
Good morning. It is normal morning time. I have sleps 4 hours maximum, but now for me sleep is over.

Was at a party yesterday, working as a barman. It was real fun.

Today afternoon visiting some relatives of my partner.

I wonder how many more days will pass without sex. *sigh*

# Day 11 - Monday, June 12, 2023
I am so glad to still be here, going on with my NoFap journey. I was alone at home yesterday evening and night, and it was a tough situation. After not being able to resist, started reading a porn book (only text, no pictures). Luckily stopped at some point. By now I have deleted the book entirely from my computer. Then I had to be strict with myself. I need to first and foremost learn self-control, and be able to discipline myself. This means being able to forbid myself from doing certain things, punishing myself when I start going in a wrong direction, and so on.

That is what I did yesterday evening, that is what I need to do so that I reach my 90 day goal.

Looking at my countdown clock is so satisfying, because there are less than 80 days remaining now. By the way, here it is: https://countingdownto.com/?c=4791824

And also by the way: Still no sex. *sigh*

Today evening is the 10 kilometre race. I hope that goes well ...

# Day 12 - Tuesday, June 13, 2023
I made a mistake yesterday with the date of the race. It is actually tomorrow evening. Luckily, I realized in time.

Today morning I nicely cuddled with my partner, and with gentle advances I checked if she is interested in sex. She wasn't. - *sigh* - It was also no misunderstanding, later we explicitly talked about it and she says that in the morning it is "too early" for her. Hm.

If she remains the same way until day 20, I may have to start getting more active and enforce her participation, whether she enjoys it or not. I don't mean that I'll force her, but I will make her oblige me.

Another working day is now ahead of me.

# Day 13 - Wednesday, June 14, 2023
I am feeling quite disoriented. Not feeling too good today.

My countdown says 77 days, 15 hours.

Today evening is the 10 km race.

# Day 14 - Thursday, June 15, 2023
I went for the race, and after completing 9500 m of the 10 km, tripped and fell, had an accident where no bones broke but I needed stitches.

Tomorrow morning I will go to the doctor. Recovery will take a few weeks, I guess, probably 3 or 4 weeks.

I wonder how this will impact my nofap journey. Positively, or negatively? No idea, let us see.

# Day 15 - Friday, June 16, 2023
I feel quite fit despite the stitches. I am on antibiotics and a low dose of painkillers. Since about today late morning, I can walk without any crutch / walking stick, but only slowly. I am making sure to have proper meal times due to the medicines.

At the moment my body is asking for sleep. I might watch one youtube video and then go and sleep for a few hours.

I am now and then thinking of the erotic story book which I downloaded four days ago. I am sometimes tempted to download it again, but up until now, I have been resisting this temptation.

Ok, until tomorrow then.

# Day 16 - Saturday, June 17, 2023
I am highly annoyed. I am also disappointed with myself. I have spent hours and hours reading the erotic story book. Just five minutes ago, I deleted it again from my phone and resolved to not download it again until 90 days are up. By that time, hopefully, I will not want to do it again.

# Day 18 - Monday, June 19, 2023
Good morning. I realize that I completely forgot to write a post yesterday. No news, anyhow. Have been concentrating on recovering. I am on my way to the doctor who will take a look at the stitches and see how it has healed. Will write the next paragraph when I have seen the doctor.
